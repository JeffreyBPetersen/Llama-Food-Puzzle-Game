	Logic
		Movement
			Each dot of the chosen color and derivative colors makes the chosen move.
				Blue/Green/Purple, Red/Orange/Purple, Yellow/Green/Orange
			Moving dots will not move if they would collide with each other.
			Moving dots will move into and blend with unmoving dots.
		Blending
			Primary colors mix into secondary colors
				Blue/Red = Purple, Blue/Yellow = Green, Red/Yellow = Orange
			Secondary colors mix into primary colors
				Green/Orange = Yellow, Green/Purple = Blue, Orange/Purple = Red
			Blended dots have the direction of the dot which moved last
			Primary and secondary combinations
				Destructive combinations leave a blank space
					Blue/Orange, Red/Green, Yellow/Purple
				Redundant combinations leave the dot which moved
					Blue/Green, Blue/Purple, Red/Orange, Red/Purple, Yellow/Green, Yellow/Orange
		Winning
			All dots are on a matching color board space
